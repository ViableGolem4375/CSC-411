I have completed this assignment on my own.

The routine that takes up the most time in the um is segmap. For improvements
to the assembly code, the main improvement I found is that a .clone() operation
could be avoided by simply pushing new_segment into the memory vector.

I took approximately 5 hours analyzing this assignment and preparing my design, and then another 5 
hours implementing and solving the problem.
