I have completed this assignment almost entirely on my own with a bit of help on iterating over 
pixels in part A of the assignment, and a bit of help with the run command for part C.

All parts of the assignment should be properly implemented.

fgroups could be used to solve a few different problems. Firstly it could be used for security
reasons in a system, fgroups could be used to check a person's fingerprints for biometric
authentication purposes by comparing their fingerprints with those present in the different groups
which could represent different clearance levels. fgroups could also be used to solve are data 
analysis and research problems. It could be used to sort and filter large amounts of data much more
easily that it could be done by hand making the research process much easier. Lastly, fgroups could 
potentially be used for forensics purposes as being able to easily keep track of large groups of
fingerprint data is useful for idenfifying criminals when comparing their fingerprints to those in a
database.

I have spent approximately 6-7 hours completing this assignment including all parts and the design
document.
