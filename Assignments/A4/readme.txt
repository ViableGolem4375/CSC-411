I have completed this assignment on my own with a bit of help from the professor and TAs over 
Edstem.

All necessary functions and files should have been implemented properly.

The architecture of my solution consists of 4 separate files codec.rs, format.rs, rgb.rs, and dct.rs 
(and a main file which handles command line arguments). Codec.rs handles the actual image 
compression and decompression aspect of the program, format.rs handles some formatting work for the
program to make the data usable within codec.rs, rgb.rs handles all of the rgb conversion math work for the
program, and dct.rs handles all of the dct conversion math work for the program. I also have a 
separate file system, containing a bitpack.rs program which is used to perform the bitwise 
operations for the program.

I have spent about 5-6 hours analyzing the problems presented within this assignment, and then 
another 5-6 hours solving those problems.
