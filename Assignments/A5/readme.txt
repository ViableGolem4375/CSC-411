I have completed this assignment on my own.

The architecture of my UM program will consist of 3 files. The first file, main.rs, handles the running of the 
program. The second file, memory.rs, will handle any memory related functionality including things 
like creating and allocating memory according to what the instructions require. The third file, 
machine.rs, will handle the actual machine instructions and their outputs, this file will take in 
the output from main.rs to operate. 

My implementation takes about 4 hours to execute 50 million instructions. I know because I ran my
implementation of RUM on a binary file which contains 30,110 instructions and did some basic math
to figure out how long it would take to run a file with 50 million instructions.

I took approximately 5 hours analyzing this assignment and preparing my design, and then another 5 
hours implementing and solving the problem.
